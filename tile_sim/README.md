For now, I'm just dumping some useful scripts for simulating a DES tile.
You'll need:
- GalSim
- galsim_extra
- [SExtractor](https://www.astromatic.net/software/sextractor)
- [SWarp](https://www.astromatic.net/software/swarp)
- [astromatic_wrapper](https://github.com/fred3m/astromatic_wrapper)

Most of this is already on some of the machines you might want to use e.g. NERSC, Fermilab DES machines....
